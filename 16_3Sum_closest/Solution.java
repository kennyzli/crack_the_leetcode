/**
 * Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the 
 * sum is closest to a given number, target. 
 * Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
 *
 * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 * maybe we can simplify the 3 sum closest to change the target -- and ++ and see
 * is there any 3 sum for the number.
