/**
 *Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. 
 * If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
 * You may assume no duplicates in the array.
 * Here are few examples.
 * [1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
 * [1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
 * [1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
 * [1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
 *
 * Solution: 
 *  binary search the node and expand left or right if the target is less than the left go bin search on the bottom section
 *  otherwise search for the top section
